# Emoji-hacks 😁😉😆 

Emoji Hacks is a chrome plugin that replaces the content of a page by Emojis! There are two modes:
- Keep the DOM: Emoji-names will also matched against tags and attributes, which will most likely create a glitchy, broken website.
- Hack the DOM: Keeps the DOM and throws emojis only into the text content.
